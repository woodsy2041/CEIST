	<h2><font color="blue">What We Treasure</font></h2>
	<p>The core values of CEIST are intended to support and nourish the lives of the people who are at the heart of our schools - students, staff and parents. </P><p>These are the members of the school; their rights must be respected and their responsibilities should be performed in a manner which promotes the spiritual development of each person, achieves quality in teaching and learning, shows respect for every person, creates a sense of community and is founded on compassion and justice. </p><p>These values can only be lived out if students, staff and parents work together for the common good of all. In CEIST schools processes should be put in place to deal with areas of conflict and disagreement so that the dignity of all members of the school can be protected.</p>
